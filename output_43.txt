The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is carried on by individual laborers, then by the workpeople of a factory, then by the leaders of one trade, in one location, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the tools of production themselves; they destroy imported goods that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories on fire, they try to restore by force the now-gone status of the workman of the Middle Ages.

At this stage the laborers still form an unorganized mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If they unite anywhere to form more compact group, this is not yet the consequence of their own actions, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which in order to achieve its own political ends must set the whole proletariat in motion, and is also still able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, what still remains of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the unimportant bourgeoisie. In this way the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory the proletariat gets is a victory for the bourgeoisie.

But with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes more and more concentrated together, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are made more and more equal, in proportion as machinery gets rid of all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers even more unreliable. The constant improvement of machinery, always more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more likely to become impossible; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois become more and more like collisions between two classes. So the workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against the bourgeois; they join together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they establish permanent associations in order to prepare for occasional rebellions. Here and there the contest breaks out into riots.

Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real result of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the always-expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the improved ways of communication that are created by modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralize the many local struggles, all of the same type, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to manage what the middle class of the Middle Ages, with their puny highways, required centuries, the modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.

This organization of the proletarians into a class, and so into a political party, is always being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it always rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It forces legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself. This is how the ten-hours' bill in England was carried.
