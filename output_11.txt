At this stage the labourers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeoisie. Thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie.

But with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes more and more concentrated together, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are made more and more equal, in proportion as machinery gets rid of all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers even more unreliable. The constant improvement of machinery, always more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more likely to become impossible; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois become more and more like collisions between two classes. So the workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against the bourgeois; they join together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they establish permanent associations in order to prepare for occasional rebellions. Here and there the contest breaks out into riots.

But with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalised, in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labour, and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The unceasing improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon the workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there the contest breaks out into riots.

Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real result of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the always-expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the improved ways of communication that are created by modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralize the many local struggles, all of the same type, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to manage what the middle class of the Middle Ages, with their puny highways, required centuries, the modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years.
