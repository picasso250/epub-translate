All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interests of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interests of the immense majority. The proletariat, the lowest level of our current society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without all the other layers of official society crumbling.

The struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie.

Up until now every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on the fighting between oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slave-like existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, in the chains of feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a real bourgeois. The modern laborer, though, instead of rising with the progress of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes desperately poor, and poverty develops more rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes obvious that the bourgeoisie is no longer capable of being the ruling class in society, and to force its conditions of existence upon society as an overriding law. It is unfit to rule because it is unable to promise an existence to its slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a situation that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.

The essential condition for the existence, and for the rule of the bourgeois class, is the creation and increasing of capital; the condition for capital is wage-labour. Wage-labour depends entirely on competition between the laborers. The advance of industry, whose helpless promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the laborers, due to competition, by their revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, is its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.

II. Proletarians and Communists

II. Proletarians and Communists

In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole?

The Communists do not form a separate party against to other working-class parties.

They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole.

They do not set up any group-based principles of their own, by which to shape and mold the proletarian movement.

The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by only these things: (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the shared interests of entire proletariat, not related to nationality. (2) In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.

The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the situation.

The immediate goal of the Communism is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties: formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois rule, conquest of political power by the proletariat.
