The bourgeoisie, wherever it has gotten the advantage, has put an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has without mercy torn apart the various feudal ties that connected man to his "natural superiors," and has left remaining no other connection between man and man than basic self-interest, than callous "cash payment." It has drowned the most heavenly joys of religious enthusiasm, of chivalry, of sentiment, in the icy water of self-interested calculation. It has turned personal worth into exchange value. And in place of the numberless and doable freedoms that were once considered sacred, has set up that single, impossible freedom -- Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation (taking advantage unfairly), poorly hidden by religious and political illusions: naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation once honored and looked up to with reverent respect. It has turned the doctor, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage laborers.

The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its emotional layer, and has reduced the family relation to just a money relation.

The bourgeoisie has revealed how it happened that the brutal display of energy in the Middle Ages, which Reactionists admire so much, found its suitable partner in the worst laziness. It has been the first to show what man's activity can make happen. It has accomplished wonders even more amazing than Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has sent out expeditions that are even more impressive than all former exoduses of nations and crusades.

The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.

The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all tools of production, by the methods of communication being made so much easier, brings all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilization. The cheap prices of its products are the heavy artillery it uses to batter down all Chinese walls, with which it forces their intense hatred of foreigners to give in. It requires all nations, on pain of of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it requires them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst, i.e., to become bourgeois themselves. In short, it creates a world after its own image.

The bourgeoisie has put the country under the rule of the towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural, and has in this way rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilized ones, nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois, the East on the West.
