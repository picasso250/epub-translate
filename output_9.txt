Owing to all the use of machinery and to division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and consequently, all enjoyment for the workman. He becomes a limb of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most boring, and most easily acquired knack that is required of him. So the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion therefore, as the awfulness of the work increases, the wage decreases. In proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of work also increases, whether by lengthening of the working hours, by increase of the work in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery, etc.

But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work increases, the wage decreases. Nay more, in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery, etc.

Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the fatherly master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Large groups of laborers, crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are every day and every hour enslaved by the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this tyranny announces that personal gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more depressing it is.

The less the skill and use of strength is required in manual labour, in other words the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men replaced by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social meaning for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.
