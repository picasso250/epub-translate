No sooner is the exploitation of the laborer by the manufacturer so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is taken advantage of by the other portions of the bourgeoisie: the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

No sooner is the exploitation of the labourer by the manufacturer, so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

The lower levels of the middle class -- the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants -- all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their small amount of capital is not enough for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is made worthless by the new methods of production. In this way the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.

The lower strata of the middle class -- the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants -- all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by the new methods of production. Thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.

The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first the contest is carried on by individual laborers, then by the workpeople of a factory, then by the leaders of one trade, in one location, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the tools of production themselves; they destroy imported goods that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories on fire, they try to restore by force the now-gone status of the workman of the Middle Ages.

At first the contest is carried on by individual labourers, then by the workpeople of a factory, then by the operatives of one trade, in one locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production, but against the instruments of production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their labour, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages.

At this stage the laborers still form an unorganized mass scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If they unite anywhere to form more compact group, this is not yet the consequence of their own actions, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which in order to achieve its own political ends must set the whole proletariat in motion, and is also still able to do so. At this stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of their enemies, what still remains of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the unimportant bourgeoisie. In this way the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory the proletariat gets is a victory for the bourgeoisie.
