But, you will say, we destroy the most sacred of relations, when we replace home education by social.

But, you will say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace home education by social.

And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social conditions under which you educate, by the intervention, direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools, etc.? The Communists have not invented the intervention of society in education; they only want to change the character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class.

He has not even a suspicion that the real point is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production.

For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce community of women; it has existed almost from time immemorial.

Our bourgeois, not thinking it enough to have wives and daughters of their proletarians to do with what they like, not even mentioning common prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives.
