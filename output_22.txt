Bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of shared wives and also, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with, is that they desire to introduce,in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalized community of women.

The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish even faster. United action, of the leading civilized countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.
