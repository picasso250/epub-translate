The distinguishing feature of Communism is not the getting rid of property in general, but the getting rid of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and deciding ownership products; that is based on the exploitation of the many by the few.

But modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products, that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.

In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.

We Communists have been criticized wanting to abolish the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man's own labour, which property is said to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.

Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of the minor artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that came before the bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of industry has mostly already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.

But does wage-labour create any property for the laborer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e. that kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except by creating a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its current form, is based on capital and wage-labour being enemies. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.

But does wage-labour create any property for the labourer? Not a bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage-labour, and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labour for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital and wage-labour. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.

To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.

Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.

Capital is, therefore, not a personal, it is a social power.

When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the property that is changed. It loses its class-character.
