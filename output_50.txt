When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. Political power, properly so called, is just the organize power of one class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a class, if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will in this manner have abolished its own supremacy as a class.

In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class antagonisms, we shall have an association, in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.

1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM

A. Feudal Socialism

Owing to their historical position, it became the chosen work of the aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society. In the French revolution of July 1830, and in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again lost to the hateful enemy. From then on, a serious political contest was completely altogether out of the question. Only a literary battle remained possible. But even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible.

In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy had to lose sight, apparently, of their own interests, and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone. In this way the aristocracy took their revenge by singing mocking songs on their new master, and whispering in his ears sinister predictions of coming catastrophe.

In this way came about Feudal Socialism: half complaint, half comedy; half echo of the past, half menace of the future; at times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart's core; but always ridiculous in its effect, through total inability to comprehend the march of modern history.

The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, as often as it joined them, saw on their buttocks the old feudal coats of arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.

One section of the French Legitimists and "Young England" were part of this spectacle.

In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different, and that are now outdated. In showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society.

For the rest, they do so little concealing the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeoisie amounts to this: that under the bourgeois regime a class is being developed, which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society.

What they criticize the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat, as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat.

In political practice, therefore, they join in all controlling measures against the working class; and in ordinary life, despite their fancy talk, they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry, and to trade truth, love, and honor for wool, sugar, and vodka.

As the parson has always gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism.
