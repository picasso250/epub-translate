Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a Socialist tinge. Has not Christianity preached against private property, against marriage, against the State? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and poverty, abstinence and ignoring the body, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian Socialism is simply the holy water with which the priest soothes the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.

B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism

The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that has ruined by the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society. The mediaeval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the ancestors of the modern bourgeoisie. In those countries which are but little developed, industrially and commercially, these two classes still exist side by side with the rising bourgeoisie.

In countries where modern civilization has become fully developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed, moving between proletariat and bourgeoisie and always renewing itself as a part of bourgeois society. The individual members of this class, however, are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, and, as modern industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society, to be replaced, in manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs and shopmen.

In countries like France, where the peasants make up far more than half of the population, it was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, should use, in their criticism of the bourgeois regime, the flag of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working class. In this way came about petty-bourgeois Socialism. Sismondi was the leader of this school, not only in France but also in England.

This school of Socialism neatly picked apart the contradictions in the conditions of modern production. It laid bare the hypocritical excuses of economists. It proved, without question, the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labour; the concentration of capital and land in a few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the anarchy in production, the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth, the industrial war of extermination between nations, the dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.

In its positive goals, however, this form of Socialism plans either to restore the old means of production and of exchange, and with them the old property relations, and the old society, or to cramp the modern means of production and of exchange, within the framework of the old property relations that have been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means. In either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.

Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture, patriarchal relations in agriculture.

Sorry, it's an impossible dream.

C. German, or "True," Socialism

The Socialist and Communist literature of France, a literature that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and that was the expression of the struggle against this power, was introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie, in that country, had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.
