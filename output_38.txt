The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of European civilisation, and with a much more developed proletariat, than that of England was in the seventeenth, and of France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution.

In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.

In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things.

In all these movements they bring to the front, as the leading question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the time.

Finally, they work everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries.

The Communists don't want to hide their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.

Introduction

Introduction

An invisible demon is haunting Europe -- the demon of Communism. All the Powers of old Europe have formed an alliance to chase out this demon: Pope and Czar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.

Where is the underdog political party that has not been labeled Communistic by its rivals in power? Where the Opposition that has not thrown back the name-calling of Communism, against its own competitors?

Two things happen as a result.

I. Communism is already treated and realized by all European Powers as itself a Power.

II. It is time that Communists should openly, in front of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this fairytale of the Demon of Communism with a Manifesto (a statement of beliefs and goals) of the party itself.

To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London, and made a draft of the following Manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.

I. Bourgeois and Proletarians

I. Bourgeois and Proletarians

The history of societies up until now is the history of struggles between social classes.

Free man and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word: oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant fighting against each another, carried on an uninterrupted, sometimes hidden, sometimes open fight - a fight that each time ended either in a revolutionary reorganization of society in general, or in everyone losing.

In the earlier periods of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into several sections, all sorts of divisions in wealth and power. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, even more specific categories.
