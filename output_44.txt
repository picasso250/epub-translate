The collisions between the classes of the old society further, in many ways, the course of development of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become opposed to the progress of industry; at all times, with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles it sees itself forced to become appealing to the proletariat, to ask for its help, and in this way, to drag it into the political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, provides the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie.

Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling classes are, by the advance of industry, brought into the proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply the proletariat with new elements of knowledge and progress.

Finally, in times when the class struggle comes close to the most important time, the process of dissolving going on within the ruling class, in fact within the whole range of society, takes on such a violent, obvious character, that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself free, and joins the revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois intellectuals who have raised themselves to the level of understanding the historical movement as a whole.

Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. The other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product. The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Actually they are reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If by chance they are revolutionary, they are only that way because of their future transfer into the proletariat, defending not their present, but their future interests. They leave their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat.

The "dangerous class," the social scum, that rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of old society, may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, however, make it more likely to be easily bribed by the reactionaries.

In the conditions of the proletariat, those of old society at large are already virtually swamped. The proletarian has no property; his relationships with his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family-relations; modern industrial labour, modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has taken away from him every hint of national character. Law, morality, religion, these are to him just bourgeois prejudices, behind which wait in ambush just as many bourgeois interests.

All the previous classes that got the advantage tried to strengthen their already acquired status by subjecting society at in general to their conditions. The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society except by getting rid of their own former ways of getting things, and thereby also every other ways of getting things. They have nothing of their own to strengthen and keep safe; their mission is to destroy the concept of individual property.
