The weapons with which the bourgeoisie toppled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.

But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons -- the modern working class -- the proletarians.

In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed -- a class of laborers, who live only as long as they find work, and who find work only so long as their labour increases capital. These laborers, who must sell themselves piece by piece, are a product, like every other item of commerce, and are because of this are exposed to all the ups and downs of competition, to all the unreliability of the market.

Owing to all the use of machinery and to division of labour, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and consequently, all enjoyment for the workman. He becomes a limb of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most boring, and most easily acquired knack that is required of him. So the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of a commodity, and therefore also of labour, is equal to its cost of production. In proportion therefore, as the awfulness of the work increases, the wage decreases. In proportion as the use of machinery and division of labour increases, in the same proportion the burden of work also increases, whether by lengthening of the working hours, by increase of the work in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery, etc.

Modern industry has converted the little workshop of the fatherly master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Large groups of laborers, crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are every day and every hour enslaved by the machine, by the over-looker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this tyranny announces that personal gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more depressing it is.

The less the skill and use of strength is required in manual labour, in other words the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the labour of men replaced by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social meaning for the working class. All are instruments of labour, more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.

No sooner is the exploitation of the laborer by the manufacturer so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is taken advantage of by the other portions of the bourgeoisie: the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.

The lower levels of the middle class -- the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants -- all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their small amount of capital is not enough for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly because their specialized skill is made worthless by the new methods of production. In this way the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population.
